# Mission to Mars
## Project Overview
The aim of this assignment consists in scraping and analyzing data using beautiful soup methodology. The project is divided in two parts as follows:
- Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- Part 2: Scrape Mars Weather Data.
## Results
We have exported our results to a JSON file for the part 1 and to a CSV file for the part 2. 

In addition to that, it is important to mention the findings of the study:

- On average, the 3rd month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the 8th month is the warmest.
- Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the 6th month and highest in the 9th.
- The distance from peak to peak is roughly equal to 687 terrestrial days.
